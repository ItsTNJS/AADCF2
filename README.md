# AADCF (Actually A Decent Chat Filter)
This is a Minecraft Plugin that combats the problem with many servers, bad chat moderation/filters,
Sometimes a server will be using ChatSentry and it'll be censoring the most randomest words you've ever seen being censored.

AADCF is designed to be fully customizable & able to support the latest versions of Minecraft
